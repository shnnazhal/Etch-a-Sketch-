# Etch-a-Sketch
In this project i will train all what i learned in theodinproject with css, html, and js. Also i want to use minimal ai. My goal is to understand that i understand all what i learnd there.




# Plan for that project

1. I need to create a web site with 16x16 squads. 
    1. Thats like chess. But instead of creating 8x8 we do 16x16. with divs.
    2. also we can look on this task like the divs are pixels on a display.
